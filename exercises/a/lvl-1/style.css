.container {
  /* TODO 1 turn this element into a flexbox with "display: flex;"

  Children will be displayed in a row, that's because by default flexboxes are displayed in rows.
  */

  /* TODO 2 use the justify-content property to center its children.

  Justify-content positions the children elements inside the flexbox along the "main axis".

  Common values:
    center (center elements)
    flex-start (position elements at the start / left side)
    flex-end (position elements at the end / right side)

  The main axis is the horizontal axis, by default.
