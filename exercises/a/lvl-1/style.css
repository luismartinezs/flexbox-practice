  /* TODO 1: Flexboxes are used to create layouts with items in one dimension (either rows or columns)

  Turn this element into a flexbox with "display: flex;"

  Children will be displayed in a row, that's because by default flexboxes are displayed in rows.
  */

  /* TODO 2: use the justify-content property to center its children.

  Justify-content positions the children elements inside the flexbox along the "main axis".

  Usual values of justify-content are:
    center (center children)
    flex-start (position children at the start / left side)
    flex-end (position children at the end / right side)
    space-between (position children leaving space in between them)

  The main axis is the horizontal axis, by default.
