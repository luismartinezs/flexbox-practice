## About this tutorial

These way this tutorial is built is a bit different than usual.

Behind it is the idea that to really learn something, repetition is needed. Most tutorials leave repetition up to the student, at most mentioning that practice is important. This tutorial aims to incorporate repetition.

Another idea is that of ever-increasing difficulty. Every exercise has levels of difficulty that progressively hand-hold the student less and less. Students should progress from level 1 to higher levels.

## How to use it

1. I highly recommend you use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open this folder.
2. If you do, then install this extension: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree), which is very handy to see the TODOs from the code as a list. If you install the extension, you'll see an icon like a tree in the side bar. Where you can see existing TODOs
3. Go to the first exercise, in the folder `exercises/a` and take a look at the `README.md`. There you have information specific to that exercise, and how the answer should look like. You can preview the `README.md` files by right clicking on them and selecting `Open Preview`
4. The go into the `exercises/a/lvl-1` and complete any TODOs in order. In lvl 1, you'll "learn the theory". You can delete the TODOs as you go.
5. To view an exercise in the browser, you can just open the `index.html` file in a browser window. I recommend you install the extension [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). If you do, just right click the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live server`.
6. You completed an exercise if your solution looks like the one in the `README.md`
7. Beyond level 1, you'll be less hand-held. Progress to the top!
