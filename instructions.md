# Instructions

This is a guided tutorial to learn the basics about using flexbox to create layouts.

It assumes some basic knowledge about html and css, but no knowledge about flexbox. It's for beginners.

## How to use this tutorial

1. I highly recommend you use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open this folder.

2. If you do, then install this extension: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree), which is very handy to see the TODOs from the code as a list. If you install the extension, you'll see an icon like a tree in the side bar. Where you can see existing TODOs

3. Go to the first exercise, in the folder `exercises/a` and take a look at the `README.md`. There you have information specific to that exercise, and how the answer should look like. You can preview the `README.md` files by right clicking on them and selecting `Open Preview`

4. Then go into the `exercises/a/lvl-1`. You'll see an `index.html` that helps you visualize the exercise, and a `style.css` file.

5. To view an exercise in the browser, you can just open the `index.html` file in a browser window. I recommend you install the extension [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). If you do, just right click the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live server`.

6. Look at the file `style.css` and complete any TODOs in order. In lvl 1, you'll "learn the theory". You can delete the TODOs as you go.

7. You completed an exercise if your solution looks like the one in the `README.md`

8. Beyond level 1, you'll be less hand-held. Progress to the top!

9. When you finish with `a`, move to `b`, and so on.

## About this tutorial

The way this tutorial is structured is a bit different than usual.

- It uses repetition to help learning and retention
- It relies on increasing difficulty, starting from level 1, which is trivial, to the hardest level

## Files

The `index.html` files import styles from two files:

- `basic.css`: General styles to make things look good, you don't need to change these
- `style.css`: In each exercise sub folder there is such a file. You will change these files to complete the exercises

## Rules

- Don't move to the next level if you couldn't complete your current level without looking at the solution. It's about you learning, not about beating this.
